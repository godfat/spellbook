[Spellbook](http://spbk.org)
======================================

This is an experiment to the models of spellbook,<br/>
a game I designed years ago, but never implemented.<br/>
It was based on Vantage Master(TM) from Falcom and<br/>
Magic: the Gathering(TM) from Wizards of the Coast.

I would import a few documents written before,<br/>
after translating them from Chinese to English,<br/>
or should i just import them and write docs in Chinese?
