== spellbook

this is an experiment to the models of spellbook,
a game i designed years ago, but never implemented.
it was based on Vantage Master(TM) from Falcom and
Magic: the Gathering(TM) from Wizards of the Coast.

i would import a few documents written before,
after translating them from Chinese to English,
or should i just import them and write docs in Chinese?
